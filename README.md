# 433sharedtests
A repo for shared public tests for UMD's CMSC433 class with instructor approval

To add a test, go to the 433sharedtests/src/cmsc433/$PROJECT_NUMBER/tests/ directory and either add a test method to an existing file,
or create a new file and named class (e.g. "SharedTests.java" with the SharedTests class).

Then send a pull request with the changes. I'll accept stuff sent over email or opened in issues for now because I 
want to get as many tests as possible, so I don't want to discourage anyone but that might change.
